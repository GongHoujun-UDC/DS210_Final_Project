This project explores the application of K-means clustering to a dataset of white wine attributes, aiming to uncover hidden patterns and relationships among key features. The dataset contains various measurements such as density, residual sugar, alcohol, and chlorides, which are particularly relevant to understanding the quality and texture of the wine. The data.rs module handles data preprocessing. The load_csv function loads the wine dataset from a CSV file, and the filter_columns function extracts only the features of interest. To ensure fair comparisons between features that might have different scales, the standardize function normalizes the data so that all features have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

Once the data is preprocessed, clustering is performed using the K-means algorithm implemented in the kmeans.rs module. The k_means function uses an improved K-means++ initialization method, which selects initial centroids more effectively to speed up convergence and improve accuracy. The algorithm iteratively assigns each data point to the nearest centroid based on Euclidean distance and recalculates the positions of the centroids until convergence. To determine the optimal number of clusters, the Elbow Method is applied: the program runs K-means clustering for a range of cluster counts (k = 1 to 10), calculates the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) for each value of k, and visualizes the results in the Elbow Method graph. The "elbow point," where the WCSS curve starts to level off, helps identify the most appropriate number of clusters.

The results are visualized using the plot.rs module, which generates scatter plots to represent the clustering outcomes. The plot_clusters functionshows how data points are grouped into clusters on a 2D plane. Two scatter plots are generated: one for "Density vs Residual Sugar" and another for "Alcohol vs Chlorides", with each cluster represented by a different color. The cluster centroids are marked as larger black dots, making it easy to identify the center of each group. The Elbow Method graph, which plots WCSS against the number of clusters, is also saved as an output file to help users understand the optimal cluster count.

To run this project, execute it with cargo run. The program outputs three visualizations as PNG files: elbow_method.png, showing the optimal number of clusters, and two scatter plots – clusters_density_sugar.png and clusters_alcohol_chlorides.png – that display the clustering results for selected wine attributes. These visualizations provide insights into how the wine's chemical properties group together, highlighting patterns that may relate to texture, sweetness, or quality.

Overall, this project demonstrates how clustering techniques like K-means can reveal meaningful structures in multivariate data. By combining effective preprocessing, robust clustering methods, and intuitive visualizations, the project makes it easy to explore and interpret complex datasets.
